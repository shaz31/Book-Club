This application makes the accessibility of different variety of literary pieces much easier and at hand. The user can either exchange/buy/sell a book through this application. Many of us have books that we don’t need any more or just want to share the book to others. They can sell the books or rent it to people who need it at a reasonable price and earn money from it. It hence, benefits people in a lot of ways.
