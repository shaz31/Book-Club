# Book-Club

People often don’t spend money on books because they believe the investment is not worth it, or sometimes they don’t have the money to buy books in the first place. This application makes the accessibility of different variety of literary pieces much easier and at hand. The user can either exchange/buy/sell a book through this application. Many of us have books that we don’t need any more or just want to share the book to others. They can sell the books or rent it to people who need it at a reasonable price and earn money from it. It hence, benefits people in a lot of ways.
